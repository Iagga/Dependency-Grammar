Before adding the relative path for each token to the dictionary, the path is reversed to follow the descending order from the root to the token. The choice of first computing the path in the ascending way and then reverse it it's due to the fact that each token owns a unique head, on the contrary it could have more than one child and the search of the descending path in that case would need more than one iteration across the sentence. \n",
